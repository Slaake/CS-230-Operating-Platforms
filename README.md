# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room was a game development company looking to modernize and expand its existing product. They wanted to redesign their Android‑only game, Draw It or Lose It, into a cross‑platform, web‑based application that could run consistently across multiple devices and operating systems. The software needed to support multiple teams and players, enforce unique naming rules, and ensure that only one game manager instance existed at any time. Additional requirements focused on scalability, security, and efficient memory usage while adhering to object‑oriented design principles using Java.
  
## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  Breaking down the different operating systems and platforms in which to develop for. I personally have experience supporting and developing application for different platforms in a business setting. I was able to use this professional experience to help develop this section of the documentation. Secondly, I do have experience working with executives and business leaders, so I have a strong idea in the points that they look for in this type of documentation.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Having never developed a document like this before, it was originally very daunting to look at. By breaking down each section and working on them and learning the purpose of each helped to make the development of this document easier. This in turn made it easier to structure code since there was a theoretical blueprint to work from.
  
## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would pick the design constraints as after completing this class, I have a better understanding of constraints of cloud verses traditional software development practices. 

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Many times, you are never told all the needs or wants from a user when engaging in a business transaction. While The Gaming Room wanted to develop their Android-only application for the web, there was many additional questions left unanswered. Some of these were if they have the infrastructure in place to support the application, did they have the staff to maintain and release updates and what was the budget allocated for operations. These needs would help inform myself and guide my recommendations on which platforms and operating systems should be used. 

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached the software designing phase by breaking down problems and functions into smaller and more manageable sizes. In the future, developing a UML diagram before writing code can save a lot of time since this can help to organize code ideas. Many times, I reorganize my code as I go when building out an idea but with an UML diagram, I can spend more time writing code.
